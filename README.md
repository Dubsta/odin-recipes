In addition to the specification, I've added:
- Bootstrap for quick and basic components and responsiveness
- Matcha css for quick and basic styling
- Some simple headers, navigation, footers, modals, etc.

## Features
- Responsive web design
- Basic visual design
- light/dark mode support

## Other notes
- Lots of repetitive code in HTML.  Head, header, footer, modals, etc basically cloned on each page. This would be better centralized.
- Using Matcha and Bootstrap together ended up being troublesome. Bootstrap has got more to offer, so I'd consider not using Matcha next time.
- While I had initial plans to do so, I didn't end up writing any custom JS.
